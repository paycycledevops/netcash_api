# NetcashApi

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/netcash_api`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

  account_number: 123456789,

## Standard Debit Order

#### Generate a batch file
To generate a batch file you will need a list of transactions. The transactions are based on the format supplied here: [Offical Netcash Doc](https://api.netcash.co.za/inbound-payments/standard-debit-orders/)

```ruby
transactions = [
  {
    account_reference: 1,
    account_name: 'Test Account',
    banking_detail_type: 1,
    bank_account_name: 'Test Bank Account',
    bank_account_type: 1,
    branch_code: 632005,
    bank_account_number: 123456789,
    amount: 50000
  }
]

batch_file_upload = NetcashApi::BatchFileUpload::File.new(
  service_key: ENV['DIRECT_DEBIT_SERVICE_KEY'],
  software_vendor_key: ENV['SOFTWARE_VENDOR_KEY'],
  batch_identifier: 1234,
  transactions: transactions
)

p batch_file_upload.batch_file_upload
# =>
# H SOFTWARE_VENDOR_KEY	1	SameDay	123	20200701	DIRECT_DEBIT_SERVICE_KEY
# K	101	102	131	132	133	134	135	136	162
# T	670	Test Account  1	Test Bank Account	1	632005	0	123456789	50000
# F	5	50000	9999

```
*** The key row will be generated based on the columns supplied.*

#### METHOD /BatchFileUpload

```ruby
NetcashApi::StandardDebitOrder.batch_file_upload(
  service_key: ENV['DIRECT_DEBIT_SERVICE_KEY'],
  file: batch_file_upload.batch_file

  p response.inspect
  p file
